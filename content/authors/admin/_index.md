I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Entomology at The Ohio State University and an Entomological Society of America Science Policy Fellow. I received my PhD in Ecology at Utah State University where I was also a National Science Foundation Trainee within the Climate Adaptation Science Program. 

My current research develops successful captive rearing techniques for bumble bees, and assesses the impact of climate change, habitat quality, and land management practices on bumble bees in agroecosystems to inform positive conservation and management practices.
